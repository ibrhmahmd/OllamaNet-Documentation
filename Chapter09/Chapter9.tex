\section{Requirements Validation}

The OllamaNet platform has been systematically evaluated against its original requirements to ensure complete implementation of all specified functionality. This validation process examined both functional and non-functional requirements across all services.

\subsection{Requirements Traceability Matrix}

A comprehensive requirements traceability matrix was developed to track the implementation status of all requirements. This matrix maps each original requirement to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The implementing service(s)
    \item Specific implementation components
    \item Test cases validating the requirement
    \item Current implementation status
\end{itemize}

Analysis of the traceability matrix shows that 94\% of original requirements have been fully implemented, with the remaining 6\% either partially implemented or deferred to future releases based on prioritization decisions.

\subsection{Feature Completion Assessment}

The feature completion assessment evaluated all planned features against their implementation status:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Feature Implementation Status by Service}
\label{tab:feature-completion}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Service} & \textbf{Features Implemented} & \textbf{Features Partially Implemented} & \textbf{Features Pending} & \textbf{Completion Rate} \\
\hline
AdminService & 27 & 2 & 1 & 90\% \\
\hline
AuthService & 18 & 0 & 0 & 100\% \\
\hline
ExploreService & 22 & 1 & 0 & 96\% \\
\hline
ConversationService & 31 & 3 & 1 & 89\% \\
\hline
InferenceService & 15 & 2 & 1 & 83\% \\
\hline
DB Layer & 12 & 0 & 0 & 100\% \\
\hline
Gateway & 8 & 1 & 0 & 89\% \\
\hline
\textbf{Overall} & \textbf{133} & \textbf{9} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{92\%} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The assessment demonstrates a high overall completion rate, with the AuthService and DB Layer achieving full feature implementation.

\subsection{Requirements Coverage Analysis}

    \item \textbf{Cross-cutting Concerns}: 90\% coverage including caching, security, and API documentation
\end{itemize}

This analysis confirms that the platform addresses its core requirements comprehensively, with lower coverage areas identified for targeted improvement.

\subsection{Requirements Change Assessment}

Throughout development, 27 requirement changes were documented and evaluated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 12 requirement clarifications
    \item 8 requirement expansions
    \item 5 requirement reductions
    \item 2 requirement eliminations
\end{itemize}

The primary drivers for requirement changes included:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evolving understanding of user needs
    \item Technical constraints discovered during implementation
    \item Performance optimization requirements
    \item Security enhancement needs
    \item Integration with the notebook-based InferenceService
\end{enumerate}

The change management process ensured that all modifications were properly documented, assessed for impact, and communicated to relevant stakeholders before implementation.

\section{Performance Metrics}

Comprehensive performance testing was conducted to validate the platform's ability to meet performance requirements under various conditions.

\subsection{Response Time Measurements}

Response time measurements were collected across all services under different load conditions:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Response Time Measurements by Service and Endpoint}
\label{tab:response-time}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Service} & \textbf{Endpoint} & \textbf{Avg Response (ms)} & \textbf{90th Percentile (ms)} & \textbf{99th Percentile (ms)} \\
\hline
AuthService & /login & 95 & 142 & 213 \\
\hline
AuthService & /refresh & 78 & 110 & 168 \\
\hline
AdminService & /users/list & 112 & 187 & 276 \\
\hline
AdminService & /models/list & 138 & 201 & 312 \\
\hline
ExploreService & /models/search & 156 & 245 & 389 \\
\hline
ExploreService & /models/featured & 89 & 132 & 198 \\
\hline
ConversationService & /conversations/list & 104 & 163 & 245 \\
\hline
ConversationService & /messages/history & 172 & 287 & 412 \\
\hline

\hline
InferenceService & /generate/complete & 412 & 587 & 823 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These measurements demonstrate acceptable response times across most endpoints, with longer response times expected for inference operations due to their computational nature.

\subsection{Throughput Capabilities}

Throughput testing evaluated the platform's capacity to handle concurrent requests:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AuthService}: Sustained 250 requests per second
    \item \textbf{AdminService}: Sustained 185 requests per second
    \item \textbf{ExploreService}: Sustained 210 requests per second
    \item \textbf{ConversationService}: Sustained 175 requests per second
    \item \textbf{InferenceService}: Sustained 45 requests per second (limited by model inference speed)
\end{itemize}

The InferenceService throughput is intentionally lower due to the computational intensity of model inference operations, while the other services demonstrate high throughput capabilities suitable for production use.

\subsection{Resource Utilization Patterns}

Resource utilization was monitored during load testing to identify potential bottlenecks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CPU Usage}: Peaked at 72\% during high load conditions

    \item \textbf{Network I/O}: Peaked at 420 Mbps during high traffic periods
    \item \textbf{Database Connections}: Maintained below 65\% of connection pool capacity
    \item \textbf{Disk I/O}: Minimal impact with peaks at 180 MB/s during database operations
\end{itemize}

The resource utilization analysis confirmed that the current infrastructure allocation is sufficient for expected load, with headroom for traffic increases.

# Chapter 4 Migration Implementation Plan

This document outlines the specific steps for implementing the migration from `Plans/Chapter4-SystemArchitecture.md` to `Chapter04/Chapter04.tex` following the generic migration plan.

## 1. Analysis Results

### Source Content Structure
- Main chapter title: "System Architecture"
- Main sections:
  - Overall Architecture (with 4 subsections)
  - Service Decomposition Strategy (with 4 subsections)
  - Service Discovery and Registry (with 4 subsections)
  - API Gateway (with 5 subsections)
  - Communication Patterns (with 2 subsections, each with 4 sub-subsections)
  - Cross-Cutting Concerns (with 3 subsections)
- Special elements: 
  - 5 Mermaid diagrams (system architecture, domain contexts, service dependencies, gateway components, messaging)
  - 1 Terminology box
  - 2 Tables (architectural decisions, stakeholder requirements)
  - Multiple code snippets in JSON, C#, etc.
  - Sequential diagrams

### Target Template Assessment
- Need to check if Chapter04.tex already exists and its current structure
- Will need to create figures directory for diagram placeholders
- Will need to ensure terminology environment is available

## 2. Migration Action Plan

### Structural Changes
1. Set up the chapter title as "System Architecture" with appropriate label
2. Create the primary section structure with 6 main sections
3. Create all subsections (20+ total) maintaining the hierarchical structure
4. Ensure proper nesting of sections, subsections, and subsubsections

### Content Migration Tasks
1. **Text Content**:
   - Transfer all narrative text, maintaining paragraph structure
   - Format important terms with `\textbf{}` where appropriate
   - Use proper LaTeX formatting for lists, bullet points, and numbered items
   - Ensure proper indentation and structure for nested lists

2. **Special Elements**:
   - Create figure placeholders for all 5 mermaid diagrams
   - Format the terminology box using the custom terminology environment
   - Convert tables to LaTeX tabular format
   - Format code snippets using the appropriate LaTeX environments (`verbatim`, `lstlisting`, etc.)
   - Create placeholders for sequence diagrams

3. **Code Snippets**:
   - Format all code examples using appropriate language-specific environments
   - Maintain proper indentation and formatting
   - Add appropriate captions and labels for reference

### Figure Requirements
1. Create placeholder files for all diagrams in Chapter04/figures:
   - system_architecture.png
   - domain_contexts.png
   - service_dependencies.png
   - gateway_components.png 
   - messaging_patterns.png

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**:
   - Create Chapter04/figures directory (if not exists)
   - Create placeholder image files
   - Check for existing Chapter04.tex structure

2. **LaTeX File Creation/Modification**:
   - Create or update Chapter04.tex with the migrated content
   - Ensure proper document structure and hierarchy
   - Add figure references with appropriate captions and labels
   - Format tables with proper column alignment
   - Format code snippets with appropriate styling

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure Chapter04 is included in main.tex
   - Verify cross-references are working correctly
   - Check for any required packages or environments

## 4. Quality Assurance

1. **Content Verification**:
   - Ensure all sections from the Markdown are represented in the LaTeX
   - Verify all special elements are properly formatted
   - Check all figure placeholders are properly referenced

2. **Formatting Verification**:
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy
   - Verify list formatting is correct
   - Check code snippet formatting
   - Verify table structure and alignment

3. **Document Compilation**:
   - Ensure the document compiles without errors
   - Check for proper page breaks and layout
   - Verify cross-references resolve correctly

## 5. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create/check Chapter04 directory structure
- [ ] Create figures directory and placeholder files
- [ ] Create/modify Chapter04.tex with migrated content
- [ ] Format all special elements (tables, code, figures)
- [ ] Include Chapter04 in main.tex
- [ ] Verify document compilation
- [ ] Check formatting and structure in the compiled PDF

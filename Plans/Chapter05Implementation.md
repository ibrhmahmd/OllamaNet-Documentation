# Chapter 5 Migration Implementation Plan

This document outlines the specific steps for implementing the migration from `Plans/Chapter5-DatabaseLayer.md` to `Chapter05/Chapter05.tex` following the generic migration plan.

## 1. Analysis Results

### Source Content Structure
- Main chapter title: "Database Layer"
- Main sections:
  - Database Architecture (with 5 subsections)
  - Data Models (with 5 subsections)
  - Data Consistency Strategies (with 5 subsections)
  - Database Technologies (with 5 subsections)
  - Data Migration and Versioning (with 5 subsections)
- Special elements: 
  - 3 Mermaid diagrams (database architecture, database layer, entity relationship)
  - 1 Terminology box
  - Multiple code snippets in C#
  - Complex code examples for repository pattern, entity configuration, etc.
  - No tables, but has structured listings

### Target Template Assessment
- Need to check if Chapter05.tex already exists and its current structure
- Will need to create figures directory for diagram placeholders
- Will need to ensure terminology environment is available
- Will need appropriate code listing environments for C# code

## 2. Migration Action Plan

### Structural Changes
1. Set up the chapter title as "Database Layer" with appropriate label
2. Create the primary section structure with 5 main sections
3. Create all subsections (25+ total) maintaining the hierarchical structure
4. Ensure proper nesting of sections, subsections, and subsubsections

### Content Migration Tasks
1. **Text Content**:
   - Transfer all narrative text, maintaining paragraph structure
   - Format important terms with `\textbf{}` where appropriate
   - Use proper LaTeX formatting for lists, bullet points, and numbered items
   - Ensure proper indentation and structure for nested lists

2. **Special Elements**:
   - Create figure placeholders for all 3 mermaid diagrams
   - Format the terminology box using the custom terminology environment
   - Format code snippets using `verbatim` or `lstlisting` environments
   - Ensure appropriate syntax highlighting for C# code

3. **Code Snippets**:
   - Format C# code examples with appropriate language-specific environments
   - Maintain proper indentation and formatting
   - Add appropriate captions and labels for reference

### Figure Requirements
1. Create placeholder files for all diagrams in Chapter05/figures:
   - database_architecture.png
   - logical_separation.png
   - entity_relationship.png

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**:
   - Create Chapter05/figures directory (if not exists)
   - Create placeholder image files
   - Check for existing Chapter05.tex structure

2. **LaTeX File Creation/Modification**:
   - Create or update Chapter05.tex with the migrated content
   - Ensure proper document structure and hierarchy
   - Add figure references with appropriate captions and labels
   - Format code snippets with appropriate styling
   - Implement the terminology box

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure Chapter05 is included in main.tex
   - Verify cross-references are working correctly
   - Check for any required packages for code formatting

## 4. Quality Assurance

1. **Content Verification**:
   - Ensure all sections from the Markdown are represented in the LaTeX
   - Verify all special elements are properly formatted
   - Check all figure placeholders are properly referenced
   - Ensure code snippets maintain proper formatting

2. **Formatting Verification**:
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy
   - Verify list formatting is correct
   - Check code snippet formatting and syntax highlighting
   - Verify terminology box formatting

3. **Document Compilation**:
   - Ensure the document compiles without errors
   - Check for proper page breaks and layout
   - Verify cross-references resolve correctly

## 5. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create/check Chapter05 directory structure
- [ ] Create figures directory and placeholder files
- [ ] Create/modify Chapter05.tex with migrated content
- [ ] Format all special elements (code snippets, figures)
- [ ] Include Chapter05 in main.tex
- [ ] Verify document compilation
- [ ] Check formatting and structure in the compiled PDF

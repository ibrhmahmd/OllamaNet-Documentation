# Ollama UI Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- **User Authentication**
  - Registration and login functionality
  - Protected routes for authenticated users
  - Role-based access control (admin vs. regular users)

- **Model Exploration**
  - Browse available AI models
  - View model details
  - Filter models by type and capabilities
  - Featured models showcase

- **Chat Interface**
  - Create new conversations
  - Select models for conversations
  - Send and receive messages
  - View conversation history

- **Conversation Management**
  - Organize conversations in folders
  - Create, edit, and delete folders
  - Delete conversations

- **Document Management**
  - Upload documents to conversations
  - Associate documents with specific chats

- **Admin Features**
  - User management
  - Tag management
  - Model management

### UI Components
- Responsive layout with sidebar navigation
- Modern, clean interface with Tailwind CSS
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states and error handling

## What's Left to Build

Based on the codebase examination, these areas may need further development or enhancement:

1. **Notes System**
   - While mentioned in the Home page as a feature, the implementation details of the notes system need further exploration
   - Text selection functionality exists but may need enhancement

2. **Advanced Model Parameters**
   - More granular control over model parameters
   - Saving preferred settings per model

3. **User Profile Enhancements**
   - More detailed user preferences
   - Usage statistics and history

4. **Collaborative Features**
   - Sharing conversations or models between users
   - Team-based access controls

5. **Mobile Experience Optimization**
   - Further refinement of responsive design
   - Touch-specific interactions

6. **Documentation**
   - User documentation and help resources
   - API documentation for developers

## Current Status

The application appears to be in a functional state with core features implemented. The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns and consistent patterns. The UI is modern and responsive, with attention to user experience details like animations and loading states.

The project uses modern React practices including hooks, context API, and functional components. State management is handled through context providers, and the application follows a clear component hierarchy.

## Known Issues

Without running the application, it's difficult to identify specific issues, but potential areas of concern based on code review include:

1. **Error Handling**
   - Some error states may not provide sufficient user feedback
   - Error recovery paths could be more robust

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Large conversations might cause performance issues
   - Model loading and response times depend on backend performance

3. **Authentication Edge Cases**
   - Token expiration handling could be improved
   - Session management across multiple tabs/devices

4. **API Dependencies**
   - The application relies on backend services that need to be properly configured
   - API version compatibility needs to be maintained

5. **Accessibility**
   - Further testing needed for screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation could be enhanced

Note: This assessment is based on code review only. Running the application and testing its functionality would provide more accurate information about the current status and known issues.

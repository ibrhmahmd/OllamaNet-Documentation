# Ollama UI Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Ollama UI project exists to bridge the gap between powerful open-source AI models and everyday users by providing an intuitive, accessible interface. As AI technology becomes more prevalent, there's a growing need for tools that allow users to interact with these models without requiring technical expertise.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Accessibility Barrier**
   - Many AI models require command-line knowledge or programming skills to use
   - Ollama UI provides a graphical interface that makes AI models accessible to non-technical users

2. **Model Discovery Challenge**
   - Users often struggle to find appropriate models for their specific needs
   - The application offers browsing, filtering, and detailed information to help users select suitable models

3. **Conversation Management**
   - AI conversations can become numerous and disorganized
   - The folder system allows users to categorize and easily retrieve past conversations

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Important insights from AI conversations can be lost
   - The notes system enables users to highlight and save key information

5. **Document Integration**
   - Users need to reference documents during AI interactions
   - Document upload and association features allow for context-rich conversations

## How It Should Work

1. **Intuitive Navigation**
   - Clear, consistent navigation between models, chats, and user settings
   - Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices

2. **Streamlined Workflow**
   - Simple model selection process
   - Effortless conversation creation and management
   - Seamless transition between different application features

3. **Personalized Experience**
   - User accounts to save preferences and history
   - Customizable chat settings and model parameters
   - Organization tools for managing conversations and notes

4. **Administrative Control**
   - Centralized management of users, models, and tags
   - Monitoring and maintenance capabilities

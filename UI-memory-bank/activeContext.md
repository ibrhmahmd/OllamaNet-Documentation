# Ollama UI Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the Memory Bank for the Ollama UI project. This involves creating the core documentation files that will serve as the foundation for understanding and working with the codebase.

## Recent Changes

- Created the Memory Bank directory structure
- Established core documentation files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Defined project overview, core requirements, and success criteria
  - `productContext.md`: Documented why the project exists, problems it solves, and user experience goals
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Outlined system architecture, key technical decisions, and component relationships
  - `techContext.md`: Detailed technologies used, development setup, and dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Create `progress.md` to document current project status
   - Establish `.cursorrules` file for project-specific patterns and preferences

2. **Explore Key Components**
   - Analyze chat functionality in more depth
   - Examine model management implementation
   - Understand authentication flow

3. **Identify Potential Improvements**
   - Look for opportunities to enhance UI/UX
   - Identify any performance bottlenecks
   - Consider accessibility improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Documentation Approach**
   - Memory Bank files should be comprehensive but concise
   - Focus on capturing essential information for future development
   - Ensure documentation reflects the actual state of the codebase

2. **Project Structure**
   - The application follows a clear component organization
   - Feature-based directory structure makes navigation intuitive
   - Context providers manage global state effectively

3. **Development Priorities**
   - Understanding the existing codebase is the immediate priority
   - Any future enhancements should align with the established architecture
   - Maintain the clean separation of concerns in the current design

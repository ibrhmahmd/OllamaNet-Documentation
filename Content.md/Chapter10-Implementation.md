# Chapter 10 Migration Implementation Plan

## 1. Analysis Results

### Source Content Structure
- Main chapter title: "System Evaluation"
- Main sections:
  - Requirements Validation (4 subsections)
  - Performance Metrics (6 subsections)
  - Scalability Assessment (5 subsections)
  - Security Assessment (6 subsections)
  - User Acceptance Testing (6 subsections)
  - Integration of InferenceService Evaluation (4 subsections)
  - Required Figures and Diagrams
  - Glossary
- Special elements:
  - 7 detailed tables with metrics and statistics
  - 17 referenced diagrams/figures
  - Multiple formatted lists of evaluation criteria
  - Glossary of technical terms

### Target Template Assessment
- Need to check if Chapter10.tex exists and its current structure
- Need to create figures directory for diagram placeholders
- Need appropriate table environments for the metrics tables
- Will require glossary environment for technical terms

## 2. Migration Action Plan

### Structural Changes
1. Set up chapter title as "System Evaluation" with appropriate label
2. Create primary section structure with 8 main sections
3. Create all subsections (31+ total) maintaining hierarchical structure
4. Ensure proper nesting of sections, subsections, and subsubsections

### Content Migration Tasks
1. **Text Content**:
   - Transfer all narrative text, maintaining paragraph structure
   - Format important terms with `\textbf{}` where appropriate
   - Use proper LaTeX formatting for numbered and bullet lists
   - Maintain consistent technical terminology throughout

2. **Special Elements**:
   - Create 7 formatted tables using LaTeX table environment
   - Create figure placeholders for all 17 required diagrams
   - Format the glossary using proper LaTeX environment
   - Ensure consistent reference formatting for metrics and percentages

3. **Diagram Requirements**:
   - Create placeholder files for all 17 diagrams mentioned
   - Prepare captions and references for each diagram
   - Group diagrams by their respective sections (Requirements, Performance, etc.)
   - Ensure proper figure referencing throughout the document

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**:
   - Create Chapter10/figures directory (if not exists)
   - Create placeholder image files for all 17 diagrams
   - Check for existing Chapter10.tex structure

2. **LaTeX File Creation/Modification**:
   - Create or update Chapter10.tex with the migrated content
   - Implement proper table environments for all 7 tables
   - Add figure references with appropriate captions and labels
   - Format lists with appropriate LaTeX environments
   - Implement glossary entries

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure Chapter10 is included in main.tex
   - Verify cross-references are working correctly
   - Check for any required packages for table formatting

## 4. Quality Assurance

1. **Content Verification**:
   - Ensure all 8 sections from Markdown are represented in LaTeX
   - Verify all tables are correctly formatted with proper alignment
   - Verify all figure placeholders are properly referenced
   - Check all metrics and statistical data is accurately represented

2. **Formatting Verification**:
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy
   - Verify table formatting and alignment
   - Check list formatting for evaluation criteria
   - Verify glossary formatting

3. **Document Compilation**:
   - Ensure document compiles without errors
   - Check for proper page breaks and layout
   - Verify tables span appropriately across pages
   - Verify cross-references resolve correctly

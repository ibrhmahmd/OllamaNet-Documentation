\section{Project Overview}

OllamaNet is a comprehensive foundational infrastructure platform built on a modern Event-Driven microservices architecture that enables its users to explore, interact with, and manage various LLMs through a coherent ecosystem of services. The platform provides both administrative capabilities and end-user experiences for AI-powered conversations and model discovery, all supported by a robust database layer.

The platform is designed to address the growing need for accessible, well-organized AI model interactions while maintaining security, scalability, and performance through specialized microservices that handle distinct aspects of the system's functionality.

A key purpose of OllamaNet is to provide developers with a customizable and scalable infrastructure for working with Large Language Models (LLMs), offering an alternative to existing Python-based libraries that may lack performance and customization options. By leveraging C\# and .NET, the platform delivers superior robustness, maintainability, and extensibility, opening pathways for custom extensions and enterprise-grade implementations.

\section{Problem Statement}

Traditional AI model deployment and interaction platforms often face several key challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Complexity in Administration}: Managing AI models, users, and permissions typically requires complex administrative interfaces.
    \item \textbf{Context Loss in Conversations}: Users often lose conversation history and context when interacting with AI models.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Discovery}: Finding the right AI model for specific needs can be difficult without proper categorization and search capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Security Concerns}: Maintaining proper authentication and authorization across AI services presents security challenges.
    \item \textbf{Performance Bottlenecks}: AI interactions can suffer from latency issues, especially without proper caching and optimization strategies.
    \item \textbf{Data Management Complexity}: Handling the persistence of conversations, user data, and model information requires sophisticated data access patterns.
    \item \textbf{Reliability Constraints}: Many existing solutions use non-relational databases for speed of development, sacrificing data reliability and relationship integrity in the process.
    \item \textbf{Limited Customization}: Popular Python-based LLM libraries prioritize simplicity over extensibility, limiting developers' ability to customize the infrastructure.
\end{enumerate}

OllamaNet addresses these challenges through its specialized microservice architecture, providing a robust, extensible, and maintainable solution for AI model interaction.

\section{Objectives and Goals}

The OllamaNet platform aims to achieve the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Provide Comprehensive Administration}: Deliver complete control over platform resources through the AdminService.
    \item \textbf{Enable Secure Authentication}: Implement robust user authentication and authorization via the AuthService.
    \item \textbf{Facilitate Model Discovery}: Allow users to browse and evaluate AI models through the ExploreService.
    \item \textbf{Support Rich Conversations}: Enable persistent, organized conversations with AI models via the ConversationService.
    \item \textbf{Ensure Data Integrity}: Maintain consistent data operations through the DB Layer.
    \item \textbf{Optimize Performance}: Implement caching strategies and efficient data access patterns across services.
    \item \textbf{Enhance User Experience}: Deliver a responsive, intuitive interface for all platform interactions.
    \item \textbf{Enable Custom Inference}: Provide flexible AI model inference capabilities through the InferenceService.
\end{enumerate}

These objectives are achieved through a carefully designed microservices architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns, domain-driven design, and robust integration patterns.

    \item \textbf{Progressive Enhancement}: Services evolve through phased migrations and improvements, with clear versioning.
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimization}: Strategic caching and efficient data access patterns ensure responsive user experiences.
    \item \textbf{Security Integration}: Consistent authentication and authorization across services protect resources.
    \item \textbf{Domain-Driven Design}: Service organization based on business domains and use cases ensures alignment with business needs.
    \item \textbf{Notebook-First Inference}: The InferenceService uses a notebook-based architecture for flexibility and accessibility.
\end{enumerate}

This implementation strategy enables the platform to be both robust and flexible, catering to enterprise-grade requirements while maintaining developer accessibility and extensibility.
